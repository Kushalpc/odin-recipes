        <li>1 ½ cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>

        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cream Butter and Sugar: In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add Eggs: Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry: Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add Vanilla: Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Frost and Decorate: Once cooled, frost with your favorite frosting and decorate as desired.</li>
